1. What does Nextjs have that reactjs doesn't ?
- Nextjs simplifies development process
- On top of that it optimises your web apps, it does that through its primary features : 

   **Rendering**
  - Primary distinction between ReactJs and Nextjs, relies on how they handle rendering
  - Reactjs render user interface on the client side, while nextjs perform server side rendering.However, nextjs provide flexibility in rendering options, you can choose to render component/ui on the client side or server side according to your needs.
  - Q. What is client and server-side rendering and which one is better?
  - Q. How this client and server-side rendering affects SEO performance?
  - Q. Why should we priortise SEO?How Nextjs solves this SEO performance issue
 
   **SEO**
   
   **Routing**
  - How do we create routing in react and Nextjs and which one is better and why?

   **Its flexibility to create fullstack applications**
  - From Nextjs v9, developer behind Nextjs introduced new feature called - `API Routes`
  - What is API routes? - Enabling the creation of serverless function to handle api requests.
  - What is Serverless API? - In nextjs, are a way of creating api endpoints without the need for a traditional server.

   **Automatic Code Splitting**
  - its a technique that breaks down large bundle of javascript code into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be loaded `as/when needed`.
  - This reduces initial load time of a website, and optimises the user experience while browsing.
  - We can achieve code splitting in react, but the process is manual. Need to do lots of configuraton `lazy, suspense, so on`. `take a look into how?`

Q1. So what's the takeaway ??
-  Frontend development have gone through various advancements - `Linting`, `Formatting`, `Compiling`, `Bundling`, `Minifying`, `Deploying` and any more.
-  However to avoid the time spent configuring these tools, developers felt a need for a `framework` that would take care of most of the process automatically. Leaving them to concentrate on the actual code. That's where `Nextjs` comes in. 
  - Automating most of the remaining processes, and
  - letting us focus on building the essential business logic of the application
 
**Final Advantage**

Its still just a react.
Nextjs is not a new technology, its still fundamentally build on top of react.
Its purpose is to simplify some/certain  task, allowing developer to concentrate on the core react code.
